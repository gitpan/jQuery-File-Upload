Revision history for jQuery-File-Upload

0.01    Date/time
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02

	added methods data and relative_url_path

0.03

	added methods thumbnail_upload_dir, thumbnail_url_base, and thumbnail_url_base. Also fixed
	bug where if thumbnail_prefix was set to '' and thumbnail and original filenames were the same,
  then the original file would overwrite the thumbnail.

0.04

	pod test failed, so I fixed it. Was missing documentation for these two methods:

	show_client_filename
	thumbnail_quality

	Also, added a little bit about how you can get access to the ctx object in the PRE/POST METHODS section.

0.05

	added thumbnail_postfix method
